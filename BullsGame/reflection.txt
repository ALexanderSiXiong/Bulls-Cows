It is a good design :

1. All the patterns are implemented.
2. Most class has less than 50 lines of code, because some methods are written in other class.
3. The structure is clear.


Why change ?

1. Initial design only considered the main tasks of the game, which is incompleted.
2. The operating mechanism of getting code from computer and human are totally different,
so ‘HumanGuess’ does not inherit the ‘CodeProcessor’(an abstract class) that inherited by computer.

3. As an ArrayList that contains all the possible answers was created in the 'Hard Level',
   both Easy Level and Medium Level can pick a secret code from this list. Therefore, the getCode method is changed.
